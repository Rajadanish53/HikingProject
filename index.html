              Trail-2 leading up to Damn-e-Koh is ashort trail. It has two
              distinct trail heads. First is located at a narrow dirt track
              astride Marghazar Zoo. Alternately, a well-marked trail head is
              present at the start of Pir Sohawa Road, short of Trail-4 parking
              area. The trail is short but steep and it takes almost 45 minutes
              to reach the top. It can be a good choice if one is looking for a
              short Sunday hike with family. The track does not end at
              Damn-e-Koh and has an extension towards the Cactus Ridge. 1.4 km
              long trail starts just across the road, opposite Damn-e-Koh main
              parking and leads to Cactus Ridge. The top of Cactus Ridge offers
              panoramas of Islamabad.

              The valley to the north of Faisal Mosque is locally also known as
              Darra Kavani.Trail-6 or the Chak Jabbi Trail is one of the latest
              trails that has officially been recognized and opened to general
              public. Trail head is located at the rear of Faisal Mosque near
              car parking. It is about 4km long and leads up to Village Jabbi.
              This trail gradually gains height and passes through thick jungle.
              After about half an hour from the start point, it takes you to a
              beautiful water spring with date and palm trees around it. The
              upper half of trail consists of steep climb and reaches to the
              small village of Jabbi about 4 km from the Faisal Mosque. Going
              straight ahead to north the trail takes you right up to the ridge
              known locally as Budho Ban where your options are to return, turn
              west on the Ridge Trail and go into another valley and come down,
              or turn east and continue walking on the Ridge Trail until you
              reach Pir Sohawa Road. Trail is surrounded by thick vegetation and
              water spring is also accessible during the hike at different
              places. It also links up with the adjacent Trail-4 and leads up to
              the parking at Pir Sohwa Road. Trail has been appropriately
              marked, is well maintained and can be done with family in about 3
              hours’ time from start to finish. The Ridge Trail This trail runs
              along the top of the first ridge in the hills overlooking
              Islamabad. The Ridge Trail begins at Boulder Pass (Kot Ban) and
              ends at Pir Sohawa Road. The total length of the trail is about 8
              km and takes four to five hours to reach Pir Sohawa Road from Kot
              Ban. The hike starts at the small cemetery from where the trail
              goes uphill along the ridge then continues on the northern side
              overlooking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa passing through an olive grove to a
              saddle with a number of ruined houses overgrown with fig trees. It
              follows the ridge on the northern side until the head of Kalinjher
              Valley and continues on the southern side of the ridge overlooking
              Islamabad, partly along the crest of the ridge up to Pir Sohawa
              Road.

              Trail 3 ascends over 600 meters up to Gokina Chauki (Monal
              Restaurant) on the Pir Sohawa road. It takes almost 90 minutes to
              reach the top. This is a popular hiking trail of Margallah Hills
              which is well marked and properly maintained. Trail head is
              located opposite Sector F-6 on Margallah Road and a dedicated
              parking area is available at that point. Initial ascent of trail
              is steep and it takes over half an hour of moderate hike to reach
              the ‘Viewpoint.’ Viewpoint offers great sights of Islamabad and
              almost all major buildings, monuments, avenues are identifiable
              with naked eye from here. For majority of the hikers with
              families, View Point marks as the culmination point of Trail-3.
              However, for the more enthusiastic ones, it is just one third of
              the journey. Beyond Viewpoint, the trail passes through trees
              constantly going uphill. Area around mid of Trail-3 is relatively
              plain. With no water source near or along the trail, it is
              suggested to carry water bottles. All along Trail 3, benches lie
              at appropriate places for rest, a luxury which is nonexistent on
              any of the other trails. From the mid-way, it takes almost an hour
              of rigorous hike to reach finish point near popular recreational
              spot of Monal Restaurant on Pir Sohawa Road. Due to its ease of
              access, proper marking, suitable resting places, appropriate
              cleaning measures and better maintenance, Trail-3 is a popular
              choice for hikers of all ages.

              This trail lies in the Darra Jangla valley, a half kilometer
              beyond trail 3 and is one of the most wooded and quiet valley in
              the National Park. This trail is also quite popular. The visitor
              facilities are located at the entrance of the valley and include a
              medium sized car park, a large forest nursery to raise indigenous
              plants, Visitor Information and Education Center, picnic areas,
              and a campsite. Earlier it was not open for the general public due
              to security concerns but can now be visited. The start point is
              located few hundred meters ahead of Trail-3 opposite to Sector F-5
              on Margallah Road and it leads up to Pir Sohawa Road. This trail
              has about three sub-trails and is also linked with the adjacent
              Trail-3. At the start point, presence of a seasonal water stream
              makes it a popular picnic spot for families. Initially water
              stream goes along the trail making it more enjoyable and in the
              mid, a fresh water spring provides a good resting spot for hikers.
              Second half of Trail-5 is steeper which requires strenuous hiking.
              At the top, it offers beautiful vistas of the Islamabad city and
              finishes near a security check post on main Pir Sohawa Road. About
              500 m walk on the main road towards west leads to Monal
              Restaurant. Trail is rigorous and is recommended for families’
              upto ‘Ficus Spring’ only.

            Trail-2 leading up to Damn-e-Koh is ashort trail. It has two
            distinct trail heads. First is located at a narrow dirt track
            astride Marghazar Zoo. Alternately, a well-marked trail head is
            present at the start of Pir Sohawa Road, short of Trail-4 parking
            area. The trail is short but steep and it takes almost 45 minutes to
            reach the top. It can be a good choice if one is looking for a short
            Sunday hike with family. The track does not end at Damn-e-Koh and
            has an extension towards the Cactus Ridge. 1.4 km long trail starts
            just across the road, opposite Damn-e-Koh main parking and leads to
            Cactus Ridge. The top of Cactus Ridge offers panoramas of Islamabad.
